Goal is to develop a Character Recognition System where a database consists of images containing printed characters of Meetei Mayek, using segmentation and Convolutional Neural Network. The CNN’s can be built using the concept of transfer learning and the base CNN’s used are: MobileNetV2, ResNet152V2, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception.

Developing an Optical Character Recognition System with high accuracy for Meetei-Mayek involves concentrated research efforts, large datasets, and the use of advanced deep learning models. It is conceivable to construct a dependable system that can contribute to the preservation and development of regional scripts in northeastern India by resolving the complexity and challenges specifically here for Meetei-Mayek characters. And this can be achieved by building a good segmentation system along with a Convolutional Neural Network with high accuracy


To build an OCR system the following subproblems are to be addressed: Preprocessing, Segmentation, Database Creation, Convolutional Neural Network (feature extraction and classification). Instead of building a CNN from scratch it can be built using the Transfer Learning which utilizes the “previous model”
